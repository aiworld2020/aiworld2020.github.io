        "description": "Founded in 1998, the Medusa Mythology Exam allows students worldwide the opportunity to demonstrate their enthusiasm and excellence in the field of Greco-Roman mythology and to be recognized accordingly for them; to encourage students pursuing the study of mythology; and to enable students to better understand the contemporary world through a richer knowledge of the ancient world. While the exam content varies each year in accordance with a changing theme, it consistently showcases a broad range of ancient Greco-Roman mythological themes and characters that meaningfully reflect the cultural narratives of classical antiquity, including those that have historically been under-represented (e.g., the stories of mythological women).",

Still appointed and sponsored by a senator, they must be high school juniors, at least sixteen years old, and attend school. Senate page duties consist primarily of delivery of correspondence and legislative material within the Congressional complex. Other duties include preparing the chamber for Senate sessions, and carrying bills and amendments to the desk. Pages attend classes in the early morning at the United States Senate Page School, a program fully accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.

Every summer, up to 40 students from across the country explore current events and world affairs through workshops and lectures led by Princeton professors, professional journalists, and alumni on campus. The summer program culminates in a 10-day residential experience on Princeton's campus, during which students publish our annual newspaper, the Princeton Summer Journal. During their senior year, students are matched with a personal college adviser, who will work with them on their college admissions process. Since our founding in 2002, PSJP has graduated more than 500 students who have gone on to attend some of the best colleges and universities and produce content for the most respected publications in the nation. Another 40 will join them this spring, as they complete their senior year and the college admission process!",

It mimics, as close as possible, the real-world scientific research and the process of presenting and defending the results obtained. Participants have almost a year to work on 17 open-ended inquiry problems. A good part of the problems involves easy-to-reproduce phenomena presenting unexpected behaviour. The aim of the solutions is not to calculate or reach “the correct answer” as there is no such notion here. The Tourtitlent is rather conclusions-oriented as participants have to design and perform experiments, and to draw conclusions argued from the experiments’ outcome.The competition itself is not a pen-and-paper competition but an enactment of a scientific discussion (or a defence of a thesis) where participants take the roles of Reporter, Opponent and Reviewer and are evaluated by an international Jury.",

Building a robot that plays soccer will not by itself generate significant social and economic impact, but the accomplishment will certainly be considered a major achievement for the field.
